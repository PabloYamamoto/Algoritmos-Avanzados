A program that solves the Interval Scheduling problem with a Greedy Algorithm approach.
Given the start and end time of n tasks, it will give back a vector that contains the indexes of the tasks you can solve


For example: 

-------- INPUT -------

Enter the number of events you wish to create: 8
Enter the starting time and the finishing time separated by a space for the 0 task: 0 6

Enter the starting time and the finishing time separated by a space for the 1 task: 1 4

Enter the starting time and the finishing time separated by a space for the 2 task: 3 5

Enter the starting time and the finishing time separated by a space for the 3 task: 3 8

Enter the starting time and the finishing time separated by a space for the 4 task: 4 7

Enter the starting time and the finishing time separated by a space for the 5 task: 5 9

Enter the starting time and the finishing time separated by a space for the 6 task: 6 10

Enter the starting time and the finishing time separated by a space for the 7 task: 8 11


-------- OUTPUT -------

Task: 1
Task: 4
Task: 7
